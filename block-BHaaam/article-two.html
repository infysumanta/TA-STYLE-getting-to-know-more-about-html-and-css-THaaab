                <p>
                    A practical combo of online food shop and blog, this one gives you recipes, freshly prepared meals
                    delivered directly to your door, and a blend of spices for even more flavor – all of them, you’ve
                    guessed it, balanced. Balanced Bites acts like your own professional nutritionist, the virtual
                    version, helping especially the busiest of us, those who don’t have any time left for cooking but
                    who won’t compromise on the whole foods and eating healthy front either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still, if you find yourself in the kitchen willing to prepare a good balanced meal, the recipes are
                    also provided, ready to impress the cautious foodie in you. And because life is more than food (go
                    figure!), Diane Sanfilippo, the author, invites you to tackle life’s latest in her Diane: Direct.

                <h2>Cookie + Kate</h2>
                <img src="./images/article2.webp" alt="Food52" />
                <p>
                    A whole foods vegetarian blog filled with delicious freshly made goodies, Cookie + Kate is
                    essentially the product of a love affair between the passion for cooking and photography. Based in
                    Kansa, Kate, the owner and creator of this hidden culinary gem, and her equally lovely dog, Cookie,
                    are the Dorothy and Toto duo of delicious vegetarian food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The magic that Kate wants to create in her recipes involves whole plant-based foods and a real
                    interest in sustainable living. Her recipes have it all: method, table of calories and nutrition
                    facts, important tips, making-of video, and let’s not forget the mouth-watering photos that come
                    with. If you want Kate’s recipes always at hand, her cookbook Love Real Food might be a good idea as
                    well.
