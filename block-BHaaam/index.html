                    When it comes to the ‘official version’, so to speak, of food blogging, the culinary magazines are
                    on top. This is literary the case with Food52, which ranks amongst the gods of the social media food
                    show with no less than 2.7m followers on Instagram. Like all the respected magazines out there,
                    Food52 has its “how to” perks – we can assure you, you won’t get enough of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here you can find how you can preserve your favorite type of pumpkin, the latest trends in home
                    design, and a hearty recipe for a cheesy green Shakshuka – all packed into beautiful stories,
                    sufficiently long enough to keep you company over your morning coffee, and delivered to you directly
                    by expert chefs and artistic decorators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And when you’d have had enough of indulging in the mouth-watering recipes and heart-stealing
                    pictures, Food52 has a shop area prepared for you, also packed with home and kitchen goodies.

                <p>
                    Here is a packed food and drink award-winning culinary website that began life in 2006, “a leading
                    resource for all food and drink”. The authors pride themselves on coming up with only “meticulously
                    tasted recipes that really work” – and that’s one good reason to check this one out rather than many
                    other food blogs that feature the recipe you’re looking for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You’ll also find a bit of explanatory science for the cooking techniques involved here, so the avid
                    reader can get a better grasp of what’s really happening while making their favorite dish. If in
                    doubt about what and what not to eat and if eating healthy is your main concern, Serious Eats’s
                    “scientific approach to cooking” makes it your knowledgeable advisor.
